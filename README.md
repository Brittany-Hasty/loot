# LOOT
https://www.lootncraft.net/
 
If you've ever played a video game that is based on crafting - you've probably needed to make some item using a set of ingredients. You then have to take that item, and use a number of them to make some greater object later, but alas - you already have a few of the items you need- what more do you need to collect to make that item you want? 
* Expansive user submitted database.
* Easily keep track of in-game loot goals.
* Contribute your own item recipes.

# HOW IT WORKS

LOOT contains 3 primary components that reference each other: Games, items, and recipes. 
1. A user can either submit a new game or enter an existing one.
2. The user can then submit an item or view an existing one within the game. 
3. Lastly, the user has the choice of viewing available recipes for the item or submitting their own.
